# FreeUtilities
In this repository you will find useful scripts that can possibly help you out. There are custom addons to existing Unity classes, such as Transform.LookAt2D and Transform.Translate2D.
  
I will be adding more and more to this over time when I have free time, so keep a look out for new things! :)
